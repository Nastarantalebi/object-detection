# object-detection
This project uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to detect vehicle license plates in images or videos. YOLO is a fast and accurate deep learning model that can identify and locate license plates in real time. The detected plates can then be further processed for recognition or analysis.
